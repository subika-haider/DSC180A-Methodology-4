## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting for me covered in my domain this quarter is all the technical knowledge about power plants and the process of electrical generation and distributon that we have learned. It has given me such an incredible insight into my work, as it has made it all a lot more exciting for me.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation that I would like to pursue in my Quarter 2 project is looking into why current technician utilization is as low as it is and how we can improve that to increase efficiency and make sure that company resources are being utilized effectively. Currently, I am most interested in figuring out how to ensure that technicians log their working time accurately, but this might change based on feasibility and time constraints.

**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

I would be more comfortable reaching out to the mentors. I felt as if I was a bit more hesitant, but since then, I definitely am warming up to them a bit more and becoming more comfortable with seeking help.

**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

I am interested in incorporating computer vision in my project. I think this is a tool that is not leveraged in the company much at the moment, and it could certainly be very useful to introduce more automation within the company. I am being very restrictive with my word choices since I am not sure of how much I can talk about the company publicly.
