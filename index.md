## Quarter 2 Project Brainstorm

**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
The most interesting for me covered in my domain this quarter is all the technical knowledge about power plants and the process of electrical generation and distributon that we have learned. It has given me such an incredible insight into my work, as it has made it all a lot more exciting for me.

**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**


**What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**


**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
